# Detect Autism Spectrum Disorder
The repo contains the implementation of a project for the Data Science Lab exam in Bioscences, completed with a rating of 30/30. It is an image recognition work in which, Using deep learning techniques, patients are classified as having or not having autism spectrum disorder.

Given the excellent results obtained in terms of accuracy, the second part of the project consisted of investigating how much these techniques are used as support of doctors in diagnosing asd, as well as investigating more generally, how research is moving in this area. Therefore, the necessary data were obtained from pubmed and topic modeling and data visualization techniques were used to achieve this goal.
